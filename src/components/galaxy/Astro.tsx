/**
 * ASTRO (#70 + #72) — the galaxy's quiet host, pinned in the reserved bottom-right
 * slot. A sibling of `<GalaxyChrome />` in the viewport-fixed `.galaxy-chrome-overlay`
 * (#76 lifted it out of `.galaxy-stage__fit` so it holds a fixed readable size in the
 * corner like the title, rather than shrinking with the stage; it never took the
 * camera/parallax).
 *
 * The sprite is decorative pixel-art chrome: `aria-hidden`, gently bobbing — never a
 * tab stop. The *words* carry meaning (#72), so the speech bubble — not the figure —
 * is the a11y surface (`AstroBubble`'s `aria-live` region). ASTRO speaks by:
 *   - **auto-greeting on mount** with the confirmed opening line, and
 *   - **re-speaking** a fresh line each time the sprite is clicked.
 *
 * SSR/Workers-safe: the spoken message is seeded in the initial `useState` (the
 * `message` prop, else the greeting), so the bubble renders identically server- and
 * client-side on first paint — no `useEffect` visibility flip, no hydration mismatch.
 *
 * The sprite wrapper stays `pointer-events: none` (clicks pass through to the stars);
 * only the click hit-area opts back in (`pointer-events: auto`) as a focusable,
 * keyboard-activatable `<button aria-label>` — the unified click trigger. Placement,
 * the bob/drift, the small-screen hide, and the reduced-motion gate all live in
 * `.galaxy-astro*` CSS (src/styles.css).
 *
 * #71 — expressions: `useAstroFace` drives the ambient idle-blink + the
 * click → emotion change. The single `onClick` is the shared trigger seam: it
 * speaks the next line (#72) AND advances the mood (#71) on the same click, so the
 * two layers stay one interaction. The face mood feeds `PixelAstronaut`'s `mood`
 * prop; the figure never shifts — only the glowing pixel-eyes change.
 *
 * Layout: `.galaxy-astro` is the **stable, un-animated corner frame** — the bubble
 * is a direct child anchored to that frame, so the reading position stays steady
 * while only the sprite bobs/drifts beneath it (`__bob` carries `astro-bob`, `__drift`
 * the secondary wander). The sprite is rendered at `GALAXY_ASTRO_SCALE` (the single
 * size knob), bigger than the prototype default so it sits with the bubble.
