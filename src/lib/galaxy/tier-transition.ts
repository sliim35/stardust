/**
 * Pure tier-transition math + narration routing for the guided tier-zoom (#125,
 * interaction spec §1, ADR-0009 step 4). This module owns the *spatial decisions*
 * of a tier change — the per-tier resting framings, the threshold framing where
 * the scene swaps, and WHICH ASTRO narration line fires for which move — all
 * headless-tested. The `gsap.timeline()` that eases between these targets lives
 * in `components/galaxy/useGalaxyCamera` (the ADR-0009 import boundary: GSAP only
 * ever tweens *toward* what this module computes, never under `src/lib/**`).
 *
 * **Framings:** the galaxy/home tier rests on the identity framing
 * (`DEFAULT_FRAMING`); the Local-Group tier rests on `LG_FRAMING`, owned by the
 * I-2 composition (`lg-composition.ts`) so the camera and the composed scene
 * can never drift apart. Because the MW's world centre is tier-invariant
 * (GALAXY_CENTER), the LG→MW descend path — rest → threshold → identity —
 * reads as a dive INTO the MW disk.
 *
 * Narration is HARDCODED i18n (en+ru) — the catalog's `astroNarration.*` keys are
 * exactly the seam the post-v1 ASTRO-AI (#128) swaps behind. The resolvers take
 * the catalog *slice*, never import a locale, so they stay pure and the tests
 * cover both languages.
 *
 * SSR/Workers-safe: no module-scope clock/random/DOM; the controller mirrors the
 * `FocusController` request-channel pattern (`focus.ts`).
